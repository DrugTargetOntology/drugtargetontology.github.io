Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is being developed at the University of Miami in the research group of Stephan Sch√ºrer. DTO was developed as part of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg/overview), is supported by grant (IDG Knowledge Management Center, (U54CA189205). DTO is a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets and is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted and inferred class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (https://druggablegenome.net/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a highly modular approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org).
